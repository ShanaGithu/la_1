            <p> Aniverse is built on pure fandom.
                We started as a couple of anime-loving nerds watching Death Note in a dorm room. Now? We’re a full-blown team curating content for fans like you.
                
                We believe anime is more than just animation—it's storytelling at its highest level. Whether you're binging Demon Slayer, crying over Your Lie in April, or laughing at One Punch Man, you're part of something bigger.</p>
